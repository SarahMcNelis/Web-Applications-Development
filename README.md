## Project Specification
Create a website with content of my choosing where I employ a common design theme/style and colour scheme throuhgout. 

Website Requirements:
1. Allow the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated (via a login screen);
2. Perform form validation through JavaScript or HTML to ensure that:
    - a. text fields are not empty;
    - b. a valid email address is entered.
3. Access and change HTML on the web page through the DOM;
4. Access and change styling through the DOM.
5. Demonstrate the use of events.
6. Contain two D3 data visualisations (e.g., Bar Chart) of your choosing
    - a. One from a CSV file
    - b. One from an array
7. Both visualisations should allow the user to specify display settings, including an option to change
colour, display size and animations.

## Conclusion
This project taught me how to plan, map and create a website using html and javascript. I feel these are useful skills for me to have obtained going forward. My lecturer warned us that CSS can become a rabit hole and he was right. Going forward I could develop this futher and and expland and improve my webpages.
